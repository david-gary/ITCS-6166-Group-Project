  abstract   = {A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer applications is to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular data item. This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.},

  abstract  = {Parameters values have significant effects on the performance of the ant colony system (ACS) algorithm. However, it is a difficult task to choose proper parameters values for achieving the best performance of the algorithm. That is because the best parameters values are not only dependent on specific problems, but also related to the optimization states during the search process. This paper proposes a novel adaptive parameters control scheme for ACS and develops an adaptive ACS (AACS) algorithm. Different from the existing parameters control schemes, the parameters values in AACS are adaptively controlled according to the current optimization state, which is estimated based on measuring the pheromone trails distribution. The proposed AACS algorithm is applied to solve a series of benchmark traveling salesman problems (TSPs). The resulting solution quality and the convergence rate of AACS are favorably compared with the results by the ACS using fixed parameters values and two existing adaptive parameters control methods. Experimental results show that our proposed method is effective and competitive.},
